        <h3>More about cupcakes:</h3>
        <p id="more">
            A cupcake , fairy cake , or bun is a small cake designed to serve one person, which
            may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, frosting, icing and various other
            cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied.Because their small size is more efficient for heat
            conduction, cupcakes bake much faster than a normal layered cake.

            Cupcakes may be topped with frosting or other cake decorations. Elaborately decorated cupcakes may be made
            for special occasions.
            A plastic food syringe can be used to squirt frosting or other fillings inside a cupcake.

            They may be filled with frosting, fruit, or pastry cream. For bakers making a small number of filled
            cupcakes, this is usually accomplished by using a spoon or knife to scoop a small hole in the top of the
            cupcake. Another method is to just insert the pastry bag in the middle of the cupcake. In commercial
            bakeries, the filling may be injected using a syringe.
